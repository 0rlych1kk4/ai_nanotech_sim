# AI-Powered Nanotechnology Simulation

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered nanotechnology simulation** built using Rust. It models nanoscale particles moving and interacting in a controlled environment. The simulation is designed to leverage AI for predicting nanoparticle behavior.

## Features
   Simulates nanoscale particles in a 3D space  
   Uses **tokio** for async execution  
   Applies **ndarray** for numerical computations  
   Implements **smartcore** machine learning models for particle behavior prediction  
   Runs efficiently with **parallel processing**
